        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between copie of <span>Nature,
            New Scientiest</span>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <span>On
                The Road</span>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the
            more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with and Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do".</p>
